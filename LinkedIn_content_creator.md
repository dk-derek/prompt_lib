Step❶ : Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

Step ❶: Define the Content Parameters

→ Start by feeding the AI the key details about your content in this format:

<input>CONTENT_PARAMETERS:

 {"topic": "$YOUR_TOPIC",  
  "target_audience": "$TARGET_AUDIENCE",  
  "content_type": 
["hook", "carousel", "post"],  
  "tone": "$DESIRED_TONE",  
  "goal": "$ENGAGEMENT_GOAL" } </input>
_________________________________________

👉 Explanation: This provides context, with the XML technical style tag, so the AI knows the content’s purpose, audience, and tone.

For example: →

• Topic: “{$Personal Branding for Solopreneurs}”

• Target Audience: “{$Freelancers and small business owners on LinkedIn.}”

• Content Type: “{$Hook or carousel post.}”

• Tone: “{$Professional yet conversational.}”

• Goal: “{$Increase engagement and shares.}”

Step ❷: Content Strategy building

My Content Strategy Analysis

• Goal: Ensure the topic is highly relevant to the LinkedIn ecosystem.

• Analyze the target audience’s psychographics (their motivations, pain points, and interests).

• Define clear success metrics (e.g., engagement velocity, comment depth, save rates).
👉 Why This Matters: It ensures your content is aligned with what your LinkedIn audience cares about and that it has a measurable goal.

Step ❸: Hook Engineering (Psychology matching Copywriting)

Create a hook matrix to ensure high engagement.

The Process:

❶. Use psychological triggers: with curiosity gaps, pattern interruption, and value propositions.

❷. Focus on solving a problem or sparking curiosity.

❸. Keep each hook under 150 characters and test for scroll-stopping impact.
Examples:

• Hook 1: “Most LinkedIn posts fail because they don’t grab attention in the first 2 seconds. Here’s how to fix that.”

• Hook 2: “Why does one post go viral while another flops? It comes down to THIS overlooked factor.”
Step ❹: Carousel Structure for Storytelling

The Framework:

❶. Slide 1: Pattern interrupt + value promise (e.g., “How to grow your LinkedIn audience by 5x in 30 days”).

❷. Slides 2-4: Define the problem, present your solution framework, and outline steps.

❸. Slides 5-7: Deliver actionable insights, proof, and tips.

❹. Final Slide: A strong call-to-action (CTA) (e.g., “Comment ‘strategy’ for the next step!”).
Explanation: This structured approach keeps your audience engaged and delivers value in a digestible format.

Step ❺: Crafting the CTA

• Keep your CTA under 100 characters.
• Use action-driven language like: “Share your thoughts,” “Comment ‘guide’ for more,” or “Save this post for later.”
Step ❻: Validate and Optimize

At every stage, validate your content for:

• Clarity: Does the message come across instantly?

• Engagement Triggers: Does it spark curiosity or emotion?

• Character Count: Hooks under 150, slides under 250, CTAs under 100.
👉 Why It’s Important: This ensures your content not only grabs attention but also aligns with LinkedIn’s platform limits.

Pro Tip:

Use performance metrics like scroll-stop rate, engagement velocity, and save ratios to evaluate success.
Output Format:

When you’re done, structure your content like this:

❶. Content Strategy Summary: Summarize your topic, audience, and goal.

❷. Hooks: Provide 3-5 hook options.

❸. Carousel Slides: Outline the structure slide by slide.

❹. CTA Options: List 2-3 concise call-to-action options.
